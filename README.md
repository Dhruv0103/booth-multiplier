# booth-multiplier
the repository contains verilog code of booth multliplication algorithms in verilog
booth.v contains code for booth multiplication for signed numbers.
booth1.v contains code for booth multiplication for unsigned numbers.
to get output run clock for 2 times as verilog code here faces rise time delay.
output is available on 2nd clock.
